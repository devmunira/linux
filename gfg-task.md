## Task-1 : User and Group Administration

- Problem Statement:

  - Develop a script to automate user and group administration on a RedHat Linux system.

  - Create a shell script to add, delete, and list users and groups.

- Using the provided CSV files (add-user-db.csv, delete-user-db.csv, and delete-group-db.csv), you will automate the process of adding, deleting, and listing users and groups.

  - `add-user-db.csv`: This file contains users and their associated groups that need to be added to the system

    ```bash
    User,Group
    john,developers
    alice,admins
    bob,testers
    mary,designers
    sudhanshu,devops
    rohit,developers
    oggy,testers
    ```

  - `delete-user-db.csv`: This file lists users that need to be deleted from the system.

    ```bash
    User
    john
    alice
    ```

  - `delete-group-db.csv`: This file lists groups that need to be removed.
    ```bash
    Group
    developers
    testers
    ```

## Task-2: File System Management

- Implement file system management tasks by creating directories, setting permissions, and managing disk usage. Use the directories.csv file provided to automate directory creation and permission setting.

- Problem Statement:

  - Create the directories listed in directories.csv if they do not exist.
  - Set the appropriate file permissions for each directory as specified.
  - Log the actions taken (directory creation and permission changes).

- `directories.csv`: This file lists directories and their associated permissions.

  ```bash
  Folder,Folder Permission
  /home/sudhanshu,744
  /home/oggy,740
  /home/bob,440
  /home/mary,700
  ```

- Implement file system management tasks using shell scripting, such as creating directories, setting permissions, and managing disk usage.
